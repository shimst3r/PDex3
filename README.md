#  PDex3

PDex3 (short for "Pok√©dex Generation 3") is the fourth project in the [iOS 18, SwiftUI 6, & Swift 6: Build iOS Apps From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/) course by Kenneth Jones.

It is a [Pok√©dex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok√©mon#Pok√©dex) containing data on all Pok√©mon until Generation 3, so the Ruby & Sapphire era.

Key takeaways from the project:
- How to use CoreData
- How to use the Chart library
- How to use the Singleton pattern in Swift
- How to create a Widget for your app

In addition, I took the time to look a bit deeper into structured concurrency in Swift using Task Groups. It sped up the API calls from 48 seconds to 1.2 seconds! üòé

After finishing the coursework, I added the Chart-based stats view also to the biggest widget. Now you can learn your speed tiers right on the home screen. ü§ì
